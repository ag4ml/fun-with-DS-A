Trying to implement various data structures and algorithms in Java

This file contains implementations of the following (found in src):

* BST
* Graph Algo (BFS + DFS)
* Hash Table
* Heap
* Linked List
* MergeSort
* Queue
* QuickSort
* RadixSort
* Stack
* Trie
* Unweighted Graph
* Vector
* Weighted Graph

Note: Implementations were to test proof of concept and may not necessarily be optimal in performance
